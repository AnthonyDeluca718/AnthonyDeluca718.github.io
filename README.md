# Anthony Deluca's personal site:

![Live-Site]()

Hi! I'm Anthony, a wed developer in NYC. I am running my personal site from this repo. Currently the site is a one-page app written using React and the React Router. The site uses webpack to transpile the javascript files into bundle.js. This repo uses Node.js as its javascript framework.
