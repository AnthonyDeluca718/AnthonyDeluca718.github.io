# Anthony Deluca's personal site:

[Live-Site](https://anthonydeluca718.github.io/)

Hi! I'm Anthony, a wed developer in NYC. I am running my personal site from this repo. Currently my site is a one-page app written using React and the React Router. The site uses Node.js and webpack as its technical framework. The react structure for my current site is overkill. However the design is intended to be easy to expand later.

This is a living page. So I have commented/maintained some content I might use later.

Take a look around!
